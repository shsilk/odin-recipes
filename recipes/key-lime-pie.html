        <h4>A Piece of Key Lime Pie</h4>-->

        <p>Key Lime Pie is a fantastic pie option with the right mix of tart and sweet. 
            It combines the citrus of a key lime with the sugary delight of a dessert.
        </p>
        <p>I made this recipe with relative ease late last year. It required a good 
            amount of effort but with a result that is absolutely worth it.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>2 c. graham cracker crumbs <em>(14 full graham crackers)</em></li>
            <li>1/3 c. light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 c. unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>For the Whipped Cream Topping:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 c. heavy cream, chilled</li>
            <li>1/2 c. powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1/2tsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the Filling:</strong> Whisk the lime zest and egg yolks 
                in a medium bowl for 2 minutes. Whisk in the sweetened condensed milk, 
                then the lime juice. Set aside at zoom temperature to thicken while you 
                prepare teh crust.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Make the Crust:</strong> In a medium bowl, stir together the 
                graham cracker crumbs, brown sugar, and salt, ensuring no lumps of brown 
                sugar remain. Drizzle the melted butter over the graham cracker mixture 
                and toss to combine with a fork, ensuring the mixture is evenly 
                moistened. Press the crust mixture evenly into the bottom and sides 
                of a 9-inch pie plate, and pack tightly using the back of a measuring cup. 
                Bake for 10 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to cool to room temperature.
            </li>
            <li>Once the crust has cooled to room temperature, pour the lime filling 
                into the crust. Bake until the center is set yet still wiggly when jiggled, 
                15 to 17 minutes. Return the pie to a wire rack; cool to room temperature. 
                Refrigerate until well-chilled, at least 3 hours, or overnight.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Make the Whipped Cream:</strong> Using an electric mixer, whip 
                the cream on medium speed until soft peaks form. At this point, add 
                the powdered sugar, a small amount at a time, then the vanilla extract, 
                while continuing to whip the cream until stiff peaks form. Decoratively, 
                pipe the whipped cream over the filling or spread the whipped cream 
                evenly with a spatula. Garnish with lime slices, if desired, and serve.
                Cover leftovers with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days.
